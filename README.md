Defusion is our exciting first step into the future with ERCn-404, a trailblazing new standard for Semi Fungible Tokens. This standard is transforming the NFT marketplace by simplifying how they're traded, whether it's through Liquidity Pools or directly between peers. We're building on the strengths of the ERC1155 standard, adding the ability to handle bunches of transfers at once, which really cuts down on those pesky gas fees.

Think of it as a blend of the best features from ERC-X and ERC404 standards. Our use of bitmap operations cleverly cuts down on the need to use up a lot of memory, and this naturally leads to lower gas usage. Plus, we've managed to make the complexity of our operations logarithmic. In simple terms, that means even if you're dealing with more NFTs, the cost per transaction doesn’t skyrocket – it's pretty much constant, no matter how many NFTs you're juggling.

Here’s something else that’s neat: when we kick things off, we mint all NFTs right out of the gate, and we don't burn any. So, if you've got an NFT at index '10' and you trade it to the pool, it's still up for grabs for someone else. This is different from the ERC-X way, which gets rid of NFTs and creates new ones every time they're transferred.

We're pushing the boundaries on gas efficiency, with transaction costs dropping to a mere 300 to 900 gas per NFT operation. That's 3 to 10 times less than the bottom line set by ERC-X. And instead of watching that gas go up in smoke, we channel it right back to the pool.

To top it off, our system is incredibly cost-effective: handling 100 NFTs runs you just 0.002 ETH, and a whopping 1,000 NFTs is only 0.006 ETH. Our protocol isn't just efficient—it’s also gentle on your wallet.
